The proposal should be done in a Jupyter notebook, and then submitted in two formats:\n",

We aim to ensure that all students in the group are well-prepared and able to contribute effectively to the final report."

Your question should involve one response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables, and should be stated as a question. One common question format is: “Can [explanatory variable(s)] predict [response variable] in [dataset]?”, but you are free to format your question as you choose so long as it is clear. Describe clearly how the data will help you address the question of interest. You may need to describe how you plan to wrangle your data to get it into a form where you can apply one of the predictive methods from this class."
